## Overview

#### What have I built?
> This is a website showcasing various interactive HTML5 canvases which I refer to as 'scenes'. There is no real order or correlation between scenes and the goal has been to showcase my progress in web-development, explore various related topics and show off my findings.

#### Why did I build this?
> This is my final project for the Web-Engineering (CPSC 458) Course at Chapman University taught by Murphy Studebaker. The purpose of the project is to showcase web design principles we have learned over the course of the semester. While we have primarily worked with React.js, the floor was open to creativity on the final project and I decided to explore the creative canvas-based javascript library, p5.js. Doing so has allowed me to create this interactive web experience.

#### What will a user gain from using this site?
> I like to think a user will gain enjoyment in interacting with my website. However, in reality I think I will be the one that gains the most from this project in the sense that I have expanded my abilities and been able to realize more power over a web DOM.
>
> Except maybe not that much power... It turns out to be quite difficult to implement p5.js scripts into a React page, I hope to explore other libraries and visual javascript programming in the future which may be easier to incorporate into React. 

#### Data storage
> The site keeps the current scene persisted in local storage. Not only does this fulfil the data storage requirement of the project, but I like the ability for the user to refresh the page and remain on the same interactive experience. Additionally, I had difficulties with getting React to interact with my p5.js sketches and local storage became a straightforward intermediary to transact information.

#### Accessibility concerns
> ~~Keyboard arrows can be used to navigate through the website.~~
>
> Additionally, the website has mobile functionality.
